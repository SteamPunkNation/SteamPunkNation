# Hey there! 👋 I'm Andrew

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer and I love working on various projects. Below are some of the projects I'm currently working on and have completed:

## Current Projects:

### Updating Discord Bot with Llama2
- 🤖 I'm currently working on updating my Discord bot to use Llama2, a self-hosted solution, instead of relying on OpenAI GPT 3.0. This project allows me to enhance the capabilities of the bot while maintaining control over the AI model.

### Personal Website
- 🌐 My personal website, built with JavaScript and React. It's a space where I showcase my skills, projects, and share files.

## Completed Projects:

### Discord Bot Amadeus
- 👾 A Discord bot I built using JavaScript and Next.js. It's designed to make your Discord server more fun and interactive. Whether it's moderation, utility, or just having some fun with your friends, Amadeus has you covered!

### Battle Owls
- 🦉 An engaging web game I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Battle Owls is a challenging and addictive game that will test your strategic skills. Give it a try and see if you can emerge victorious! [Try it on Github Pages!](https://steampunknation.github.io/BattleOwls/)
